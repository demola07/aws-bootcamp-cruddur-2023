## Installing AWS CLI

I was able to install the aws cli both on gitpod and also on my windows wsl

### Installing AWS CLI on windows wsl

  I followed the instructions in the [AWS CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and was able to install the **aws cli** successfully
